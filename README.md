# Multilayer perceptron - Academic project

A multilayer perceptron implementation in Python.

To start off, clone this branch of the repo into your local:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/aL0NEW0LF/multilayer-perceptron-py
```

After cloning the project, create your virutal environment:

```shell
cd multilayer-perceptron-py
```

**Windows**

```shell
py -3 -m venv .venv
```

**MacOS/Linus**

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Then, activate the env:

**Windows**

```shell
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

**MacOS/Linus**

```shell
. .venv/bin/activate
```

You can run the following command to install the dependencies:

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you are good to go.

# TODO

- [ ] Implement it _KEKW_
- [X] Choose the number of hidden layers to have, choose the number of neurons in each hidden layer and activation function in each layer
- [ ] Figure out why the testing results are bad (Somewhere in weight or error computing probably, or initialization)
- [ ] Fix the `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in exp` bug/runtime-error
